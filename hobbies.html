    <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
    <hr>
    <p>One of the things I love the most is music. When I'm not reading, I love to code with music in the background. I love a wide range of genres of music, but I mostly love to code with Jazz instrumentals, or gospel worship songs.</p>

    <p>When I want to activate my mind, I play classical music such as Beethoven, Mozart, and the likes.</p>

    <p>In addition to listening to music. I also sing, and in 2023, I started learning to play the acoustic guitar.</p>

    <p>One other thing I love to do is excercise. I take my mental and physical well-being so seriously that I don't joke with working out. In fact, I take it quite seriously that I don't know whether it is fit to be categorized as a hobby &#x1F601;.</p>

    <p>I currently mostly do body-weight excercises such as push ups, pull ups, squats, planks, and a couple others. However, I have a plan to maintain a subscription with a gym to attain my body goals and keep fit.</p>
